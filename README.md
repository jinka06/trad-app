This project is a simple trad app.
You will have a textarea where you will be able to input a first sentence then select between a few list of languages.
After having clicked on the "translate" button, the app will then set up the chatbot interface where you will first have your sentenced translated in the selected language and afterwards you will be able to chat with the bot in the selected language.
Warning: The bot will always answer in the language selected but the user can use any language they want. The goal here is to ensure that you understand what the bot tells you and respond intelligibly to it. In the proper language would be best.
